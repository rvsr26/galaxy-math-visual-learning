# Research Foundations for Galaxy Math (ASD Focus)

The features in Galaxy Math are developed based on peer-reviewed research specifically targeting children with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** and other **neurodevelopmental disorders**.

## Feature-Specific Educational Mapping

### 1. Multi-modal Interaction (Voice, Keyboard, Touch)
- **Research Basis**: *Knight et al. (2019)* mentions that multi-modal input helps bridge cognitive gaps for students with **disorders**, allowing them to express mathematical knowledge without being blocked by motor or language difficulties.
- **In our app**: Voice recognition and keyboard shortcuts (1, 2, 3) directly support this recommendation.

### 2. Virtual Manipulatives (3D Cards, Cookie Sharing)
- **Research Basis**: *Bouck et al. (2016)* in "Updated Evidence-Based Practice Review" identifies technology-aided instruction and manipulatives as core evidence-based practices for students with **moderate to severe developmental disabilities**.
- **In our app**: The 3D memory cards and the interactive cookie sharing in Division Game translate abstract concepts into tangible digital actions.

### 3. Multisensory Feedback (Sound + Vision)
- **Research Basis**: *Monster Math App Research* and *AllAboutABA* note that multisensory teaching (audio + visual) leads to a 30-45% improvement in concept retention for **children with autism**.
- **In our app**: Auditory tones in Simon Says (Sequence Game) and the "correct/wrong" sounds provide immediate sensory confirmation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These papers confirm that technology-assisted interventions for **autism** are most effective when they provide clear visual structure, immediate feedback, and multiple ways to respond.
